For many, the national song is more than just a melody; it is a powerful invocation of India's freedom struggle and a tribute to the Motherland. The discussion allowed political parties to stake a claim on the legacy of the freedom movement, with debates focused on historical omissions, ideological differences, and the song's unifying power.<br><br>Ten hours were spent dissecting the nuances of tradition, constitutional mandates, and cultural reverence. This passionate and lengthy deliberation certainly served the purpose of highlighting the importance of the national song and showcasing the fervor of patriotism within the House.<br><br><u><strong>But the question remains: Was the timing right?<br></strong></u><br><strong><u>The Elephant in the Room: India's Deepening Pollution Crisis</u></strong></p><p><strong><br></strong>Meanwhile, as the heated discussion about a song played out within the hallowed halls of Parliament, millions of Indians outside were struggling with a far more immediate and existential threat: Air Pollution.<br><br>The air we breathe is no longer just air—it's a toxic cocktail. The facts are stark and terrifying, painting a picture of a public health emergency that cuts across all demographics.</p><p><br><u><strong>Hazardous AQI Levels</strong></u></p><p>While 'Good' air quality is an AQI of 0-50, many major Indian cities routinely report numbers that place them in the 'Poor', 'Very Poor', or even 'Severe' categories. For example, recent AQI readings in the National Capital Region (NCR) and surrounding areas have frequently hit levels like 250-400+, with cities like Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, and Lucknow struggling to breathe. Hapur, for instance, has recently recorded levels as high as 416 ('Severe').<br><br><strong>Health Crisis</strong>: Studies estimate that long-term exposure to contaminated air contributes to nearly 1.7 million deaths in India annually, with toxic PM2.5 particles penetrating deep into the lungs and bloodstream. Doctors have publicly declared the situation a full-blown health emergency, noting a surge in respiratory illnesses and related deaths.<br><br>National Problem: The issue is not restricted to the North. As many as 60% of India's districts breach the country's own National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for PM2.5, indicating a nationwide crisis.<br><br>The 10-hour parliamentary window, which could have been dedicated to finding coordinated, cross-party solutions to this life-threatening crisis, was instead spent on a symbolic debate.</p><p><br><u><strong>The Public's Verdict: A Question of Wise Resource Utilisation</strong></u></p><p>In the face of an invisible killer that stalks every street and every home, the public is rightly questioning the Parliament's priorities. The crisis is multifaceted, requiring legislative action on everything from industrial emissions and vehicular pollution to agricultural practices and construction dust. It demands a unified front from elected representatives, not a political blame game.<br><br>The public is now finding fault with both the ruling party and the opposition.<br><br>&gt;&gt;The ruling party is criticised for using the session to focus on a political-cultural issue to score points, diverting attention from its responsibility to deliver clean air.<br><br>&gt;&gt;The opposition is criticised for not aggressively forcing the conversation back to the pollution crisis, allowing a day of legislative time to be consumed by a less immediate issue.<br><br>Patriotism is essential, but a living, breathing citizen is more so. Patriotism is best demonstrated not just through the singing of a song, but through the dedicated, effective use of power and resources in the favour of the people of India. Using Parliament's valuable time to resolve a health emergency is, arguably, the highest form of national service.<br><br>We need our lawmakers to shift their focus from the symbolic to the substantial—from debating the meaning of the Motherland to preserving the health of her children.<br><br><strong>What are your thoughts?<br>Do you believe Parliament should have prioritised the pollution debate over the discussion on Vande Mataram?</strong></p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on
